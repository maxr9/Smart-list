# Smart-list
## Basic idea:
Online recipe site. Keeping track of purchases using your registered account. Serve as a reminder for future purchases. Fancy expense reporting to see where your money goes. Host the flask app and SQL databases on GCP.  

## Additional features:
Receipt scanning using Vision API and automatic upload of products to user history. Healthiness analysis of purchases and proposal of alternatives to have a balanced diet. Add recipe ingredients using the recipe ingredient database to the shopping list. Take a picture and choose a recipe and add it to the shopping list.

## Comments:
The additional features are the ones we think will be more time consuming and more difficult to implement. Therefore, as a beginning, we plan on having a site which analyses previous purchases (manually inputted by user) and outputs a possible shopping list for the user. Then, the additional features will serve to better the user experience by requiring less or no manual input. Also, some features that add recipes from databases to the shopping list are planned. In addition, the food intake analysis can become more advanced.
